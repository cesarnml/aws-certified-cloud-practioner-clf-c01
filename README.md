## Lesson Notes

### 1. Introduction

- AWS Cloud Practioner Exam - CLF-C02
- Will cover ~40 AWS services (out of 400+)
- Stephane Maarek (instructor)

### 2. What is Cloud Computing

- Client-Network-Model
- Server composed of:
  - 1. Compute
  - 2. Memory
  - 3. Storage
  - 4. Database
  - 5. Network
- Problems with traditional IT:
  - 1. High initial CAPEX
  - 2. Maintenance staff cost
  - 3. Ongoing upgrade/scaling monetary/time costs/constraints
- Cloud Computing:
  - 1. `on-demand delivery`
  - 2. `pay-as-you-go pricing`
  - 3. `provision exactly the right type and size of computing` that is needed
- 5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing
  - 1. `On-Demand Self Service`
  - 2. `Broad Network Access`
  - 3. `Multi-tenancy and Resource Pooling`
  - 4. `Rapid Elasticity and Scalability`
  - 5. `Measured Service`
- 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing
  - 1. Trade CAPEX for OPEX
  - 2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - 3. Stop guessing capacity
  - 4. Increase speed and agility
  - 5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining your own data centers
  - 6. Go global in minutes
- Problems solved by going Cloud
  - 1. Flexibility
  - 2. Cost-Effectiveness
  - 3. Scalability
  - 4. Elasticity
  - 5. High-availability and fault tolerance
  - 6. Agility
- History
  - 2002: AWS Internally launched
  - 2004: SQS first offering
  - 2006: Relaunched publicly with SQS, S3 & EC2
  - 2007: Europe release
- AWS Global Infrastructure
  - AWS Regions
    - Compliance, Proximity, Available Services, Pricing
  - AWS Availability Zones
    - Each regions has multiple AZ (3 - 6)
    - Each AZ is a discrete data center(s)
    - Isolated
    - Connected via high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
  - AWS Data Centers
  - AWS Edge Locations/Points of Presence
- AWS has `Global Services`
  - IAM, Route53, CloudFront, WAF
- AWS has `Region-scoped` services:
  - Amazon EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Rekognition
- Shared Responsibility Model
  - Customer responsible for the security `IN` the cloud
  - AWS responsible for the security `OF` the cloud
- AWS Acceptable Policy

### 3. IAM - Identity and Access Management

- `Root account` created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- `Users` are people within your organization - can be
- `Groups` only contain users, not other groups
- Permissions assigned via JSON documents called `Policies`
  - `Least privilege principle`
- Policies can be attached to a group and the users of the group will all inherit the policy
- Or, policies can be `inlined` and only apply to a specific user
- IAM Policies Structure has 3 parts:
  - Version: "2012-10-17"
  - Id: identified for policy (optional)
  - Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
    - Sid: identified (optional)
    - Effect: `Allow` or `Deny`
    - Principal: `account`, `user` or `role` which policy applies to
    - Action: list of actions allowed or denied by policy
    - Resource: list of resources that policy applies to
- ARN: Amazon Resource Name
- MFA: Multi-Factor Authentication
  - MFA = password you **know** + security device you **own**
- Best practice to use MFA on Root Account and **all** IAM users
- MFA options:
  - Virtual MFA Device:
    - Google Authenticator
    - Authy
  - Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Key (Security Key)
    - YubiKey
  - Hardware TOTP token
- 3 Ways to Access AWS:
  - AWS Management Console (protected by: password + MFA)
  - AWS CLI (protected by: access keys)
  - AWS SDK (protected by: access keys)
- Access Keys are generated via AWS Management Console
- `aws configure` - to setup aws cli with access key
- AWS CloudShell - browser-based terminal to interact with `aws-cli`
- IAM Roles (how we give permission to AWS Services)
  - EC2 Instance Roles
  - Lambda Function Roles
  - Roles for CloudFormation
- IAM Security Tools:
  - IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
  - IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
- Shared Responsibility Model
  - AWS: Infrastructure, Configuration, Compliance Validation
  - User (Me): Users, Groups, Policies, Management and Monitoring, Access Security
- IAM Summary:
  - ![](img/Screenshot%202024-01-03%20at%2010.12.03 AM.png)

### 4. EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

- Amazon EC2 - Infrastructure as a Service
  - Renting virtual machines (EC2 instances)
  - Storage (EBS or EFS)
  - Load balancers (ELB)
  - Scale services - Auto-scaling group (ASG)
- EC2 User Data (script):
  - bootstrap commands to initialize EC2 instance on initial boot
- EC2 instance types:
  - `t2.micro`
  - `t` - instance `class`
  - `2` - instance `generation`
  - `micro` - instance `size`
- Types:
  - General Purpose (t)
  - Compute Optimized (c)
  - Memory Optimized (r)
  - Storage Optimized (i,d,h1)
  - [EC2 Instance Type Comparison Site](https://instances.vantage.sh/)
- Security Groups - fundamental to `network security` in AWS
  - Control how traffic is allowed in and out of EC2 instances
  - Only contain `allow` rules
  - Can reference by IP or security group
  - By default: All in-bound traffic is BLOCKED; All out-bound traffic is ALLOWED
- Ports to Know:
  - ![](img/Screenshot%202024-01-03%20at%201.45.51 PM.png)
- SSH Login instructions:
  - Use `.pem` key and change permission to `chmod 0400 FILE.pem`
  - Run: `ssh -i FILE.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_IP`
- EC2 Instance Connect - browser-based access to an EC2 Instance via AWS Management Console
- EC2 Instance Roles - authorize services for a given instance
- EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
  - ![](./img/Screenshot%202024-01-03%20at%203.07.14 PM.png)
  - EC2 On Demand: billing per second, after first minute
  - EC2 Reserve Instances: Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS, Reservation Period (1-,3-years), Payment Options, Good for databases, Resell in Reserved Instance Marketplace - Convertible Reserved Instance for a bit more flexibility but less savings
  - EC2 Savings Plans - locked payment/hour then On-Demand, locked type
  - EC2 Spot Instances - MOST cost-efficient - good for batch jobs, image processing, data analysis, flexible start/end time, distributed workloads; not suitable for critical jobs/databases
- EC2 Summary:

### 5. EC2 Instance Storage

- Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volume is a `network drive` that can be attached to an EC2 Instance - must be on same AZ
- EBS Snapshots - backup EBS Volumes
  - Useful in order to move an EBS volume to a different AZ
  - Recommended to detach EBS volume prior to generating snapshot
  - Features:
    - EBS Snapshot Archive - cheaper cost but delay in restore (1-3 days)
    - EBS Snapshot Recycle Bin - prevents accidental deletion of EBS Snapshots (1-day to 1-year)
- AMI - Amazon Machine Image - a \*_customization_ of an EC2 instance
  - There are **public** AMIs managed by AWS
  - Can create **custom** AMIs
  - Can launch **AWS Marketplace AMI**
- EC2 Image Builder - used to automate the creation of VMs or container images
  - Creation, Maintain and Validate EC2 AMIs
  - Can run on a schedule
- EC2 Instance Store - high-performance hardware disk (better than EBS - network)
  - ephemeral
  - Good for buffer / cache / scratch data - not good for long-term storage
  - Must be backup and replicate as needed by service
- EFS - Elastic File System (Managed NFS) can be mounted to 100s of EC2 instances
  - works only on Linux EC2 and in multi-AZ
  - EFS-IA (Elastic File System - Infrequent Access) - 92% lower cost
  - Storage class is cost-optimized for files not accessed frequently via Life Cycle Policy
- Amazon FSx
  - Launch 3rd party HPFS (High-Performance FileSystem)
    - For Lustre - High Performance Computing - Machine Learning/Analytics/Financial Modeling
    - For Windows File Server
    - For NetApp ONTAP
